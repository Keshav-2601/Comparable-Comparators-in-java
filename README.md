This project help you to understand the concept of Comparator and Comparable . Both Terms look very similiar but have nminor difference . first of all Both are generic interfaces and both interfaces have generic two methods
: -Comparator Methods:
->compare(T o1,T o2) here T is generic(<T>)
-> Equal(T o) 
->use for Multiple Sorting 

:-Comparable Method:-only have one generic method
 ->compareTO(T other) where (<T> is generic)
 -> Use for Single sorting or natural sorting
